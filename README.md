The purpose of this project is to understand what features of a country make it attractive for Starbucks investment.

Shiny_Project_Script.R has the code for the data analysis. The ui.R, gloabal.R, and server.R are for the R Shiny app. The Shiny_Markdown.Rmd is a short summary of the project. Shiny_data.csv is the dataset.
